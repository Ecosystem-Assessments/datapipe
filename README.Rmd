*pipedat* is a package that provides pipelines to access, load, and format a variety of data from multiple sources programatically. The intent of this package is to support the varying projects undertaken under the umbrella organization *Ecosystem Assessments*. Certain datasets are directly accessed through APIs and open data portals, while others require a local copy of the raw data for varying reasons such as data whose distribution is limited or protected by data sharing agreements. The sole purpose of this package is to facilate the reproducible use and reuse of specific datasets accross different projects.

## Installation

The easiest way to install `pipedat` is to use [`remotes`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=remotes):

``` r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("Ecosystem-Assessments/pipedat")
```

Then, load it:

```r
library(pipedat)
```

## Main features 

The `pipedat` package is built around function called `pipedat()` that is used to access, load and format a wide variety of data; this function calls on a series of individual scripts built to access data programmatically and reproducibly, which we refer to as *data pipelines*. Individual data pipelines are executed by using their *unique identifier*, which are specific to the `pipedat` package. The full list of data pipelines available can be viewed with the `pipelist()` function: 

```r
# View list of pipelines 
# pipelist()

# Download and format a single dataset 
# pipedat("a3jsd4jh")

# Download and format multiple datasets
# pipedat(c("a3jsd4jh","a8732975y","soif8yiao"))
```

By default, the `pipedat()` function will export the raw and formatted data in folders 'data/data-raw/' and `data/data-format`, respectively. 

## List of pipelines 

### Data pipelines

```{r echo = FALSE}
pipedat::pipelist("data")
```

### Integration pipelines

```{r echo = FALSE}
pipedat::pipelist("integration")
```

## How to contribute

External contributors are welcome to contribute data pipelines to this package. Simply fork the [public repo]() and create your own data pipeline. The `pipenew()` function creates a `dp_#####.R` template for you to use to create a new data pipeline with a unique id. Create a pull request for us to review the data pipeline for inclusion in the package. 

A single pull request per pipeline should be created, and merged pull requests should be squashed into a single commit.
